This directory contains assembled sequence data, input files, trees, and scripts used for investigation early diverging leech relationships. 

~/Alignments/
contains all concatenated sequence files used 

All_genes.phy = the full alignment
Bacoca_and_townsend_et_al_filtered.phy = alignment filtered by base frequency and QIHP
Dataset_townsend_et_al_filtered = alignment filtered by QIHP

~/Partitionfinder/
contains all input files and output for identification of data partitioning strategies for the above alignments

~/Gene_trees/	
contains gene trees used for ASTRAL

~/Locus_alignments/ 
contains alignments of each locus, file names correspond to locus identifications from the AHE probe set

~/Legacy_Markers/
Contains alignments and estimated site rates of sanger-sequence era markers used for leech phylogenetic work

~/Site_Rates/
Contains site rates and R scripts used in for investigations of phylogenetic information
